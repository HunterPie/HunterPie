HunterPie v2.6.0 is finally here with a lot of new features!

## <ion-icon name="person-sharp"></ion-icon> Player HUD Widget

This new widget is responsible for displaying your character's health, stamina and sharpness in a simple health bar, it also displays how many hits you have left until your sharpness level decreases.

The widget's design is the following:

You can also see it in action in the video below:

The player HUD does not display buffs on top of the player's health bar, for that you need to use the [Abnormalities Widget](/posts/abnormality-tray-widget).

> **Tip:** Refer to the [documentation](/posts/player-hud-widget) for more information.

## <ion-icon name="hardware-chip-sharp"></ion-icon> Optimizations

This update also brings some minor and major optimizations to HunterPie, below you can see the benchmark comparing both the old scanning method and the new one.

Although the new implementation is only 12% faster, it is a lot more stable when you compare the slowest scan passes compared to the old implementation.
