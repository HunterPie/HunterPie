HunterPie v2.6.0 is finally here with a lot of new features!

## <ion-icon name="person-sharp"></ion-icon> Player HUD Widget

This new widget is responsible for displaying your character's health, stamina and sharpness in a simple health bar, it also displays how many hits you have left until your sharpness level decreases.

The widget's design is the following:

## <ion-icon name="hardware-chip-sharp"></ion-icon> Optimizations

This update also brings some minor and major optimizations to HunterPie, below you can see the benchmark comparing both the old scanning method and the new one.

Although the new implementation is only 12% faster, it is a lot more stable when you compare the slowest scan passes compared to the old implementation.
