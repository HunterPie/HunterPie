HunterPie v2.7.0 is finally here with a lot of new features!

## <ion-icon name="unlink-sharp"></ion-icon> HunterPie Account - Hunt Export

The Hunt Export is a feature that will be split in two parts, the first one is coming on this version of HunterPie, it consists of tracking your hunt data and once the quest is over, exporting it and linking it to your HunterPie account so you can see that data in a dashboard.

The second part of this feature will come on v2.8.0, which is the actual UI that you can use to visualize the exported data.

Here's a sneak peek of the dashboard that will be released in v2.8.0:

> **Note:** The UI in the video is not the final result and WILL be changed to look better.
