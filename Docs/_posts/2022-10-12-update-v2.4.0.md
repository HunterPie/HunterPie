HunterPie v2.4.0 is finally here with a lot of new features!

## <ion-icon name="people-sharp"></ion-icon> Accounts

HunterPie accounts will be part of HunterPie's core features, although it is not required to have one to use the overlay, HunterPie will be getting more account-related features in the upcoming updates. Here are some of the planned features that **will** require an account:

- HunterPie configuration cloud synchronization;
- Hunt details;

> **Tip:** Refer to the [documentation](/posts/account) for more information.
